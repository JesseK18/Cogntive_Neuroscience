The MNIST.ipynb contains the traditional ANNs and CNN trained on MNIST and evaluated on both MNIST and the external dataset fo handwritten digits (digits_X.npy and digits_y.npy).
The spiking-mnist.ipynb in docs contains the spiking CNN (SCNN). 
Note that the spiking-mnist.ipynb is from https://colab.research.google.com/github/nengo/nengo-dl/blob/master/docs/examples/spiking-mnist.ipynb
The SCNN provided by nengo is tested on the external datasets from digits_X.npy and digits_y.npy.
